            <p>I'm a self-taught developer born and raised in North London. My journey into web development began  in early 2022, this was my "where have you been all my life" moment. Since I was young, I've always loved creating things, and I'd use whatever tools I could get my hands on. I remember using Microsoft Paint, Windows Movie Maker, and even the trial version of Virtual DJ to make an animation for a school presentation. And before I got my hands on Photoshop, I relied on Paint to create lightning bolts for my Myspace page. Back in school, my favorite subjects were math, PE, and IT. I discovered that I learn best when I can apply what I've learned and solve problems hands-on. Fast forward to the nearer past, while working as a sports play leader in a primary school, I channeled my efforts into the music industry. I explored different areas and eventually found my passion in music production.</p>

            <p class="margin-top-10">
              I've always enjoyed the mix of collaboration sessions and working on projects with other artists, as well as working independently in my bedroom, at the park, or wherever I could take my laptop. There's a certain thrill in returning and showcasing my new ideas or the changes I've made. Being able to contribute to my community, whether through my school work or my creative outlet of building songs, brings me great satisfaction. However, I am at a stage where I need to be earning more in order to become independent and continue my journey through this world. I experienced limited options for progression as a play leader, and as time went on, I began to feel the financial strain from the continuous increase in the cost of living overshadowing my current earnings. This changed my motivation for making music very much so to the point where I began to no longer enjoy it. I am a believer in "Do what you love & love what you do"; it's a way of giving purpose to life. So I began searching for a suitable career path that would not only match my skills but also provide me with enjoyment, a challenge from which I can siphon satisfaction. An environment where I am responsible for my progression and where me being better is good for me as well as those around me. I was preparing to become a content creator, and it was while showing my friend some of the drafts I made after tinkering with Nch Video Editor, Gimp, and Canva that he suggested that I look into "Web Development." He had been working as a web developer for about 2 years right after finishing a bootcamp, and he has been my mate for nearly 10 years. His following statement after his suggestion was

                <span class="tooltip-text">Best Friends ðŸ™„ am I right ðŸ˜‚</span>

            <p>Once I had made up my mind, I decided to dive into learning the basics of HTML and CSS through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" class="external-links">FreeCodeCamp</a>. It was a great starting point for me, and after achieving the '<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/chibsdev/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" class="external-links">Responsive Web Design</a>' Certification, I felt ready to tackle the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course. However, I found myself struggling to fully grasp JavaScript through the provided text-based resources. That's when I stumbled upon <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript" target="_blank" class="external-links">Scrimba</a>, an interactive code-learning platform that utilized video demonstrations. I completed their free JavaScript course, gaining more confidence, and then went back to FreeCodeCamp to finish the JavaScript module.
            To practice and apply what I had learned, I started exploring tutorials and coding challenge websites such as <a href="https://devchallenges.io/" target="_blank" class="external-links">DevChallenges.io</a> and <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank" class="external-links">FrontEndMentor.io</a>. It was towards the end of last year that I felt confident enough to build my own portfolio. However, when I started applying for positions, I found myself feeling underqualified. In an attempt to improve my chances, I picked up PHP and built a PHP project, along with creating several WordPress websites. Unfortunately, my efforts didn't yield the desired results, and I began to question whether recruiters were even looking at my portfolio without commercial experience on my CV.

            <p class="margin-top-10">              
              Feeling a bit lost, I had to admit that I didn't have a clear direction. Each language, framework, and library I learned seemed to open up its own rabbit hole, and knowing when to move on to the next one was a challenge. I realized that making that judgment by myself was difficult, especially considering my eagerness to enter the tech space. Additionally, the lack of commercial experience on my CV was a concern. I needed a new solution.
              It became increasingly clear to me that with the vastness of the tech industry and my inherent curiosity for new things, I needed to be in a more structured environment that would challenge me. I wanted my work to have meaning and I desired a tech stack which I could build my skills around.
              I am convinced that an apprenticeship is the obvious option. It would provide me with structured learning, along with real work experience and the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals. In the early hours of May 23rd, I came across the 'Founders and Coders' apprenticeship. What attracted me the most to 'Founders & Coders' was their unique application process. It's a creative way to truly understand what an applicant is capable of and made me even more enthusiastic about the opportunity. It so happened that FAC were hosting an information night that very evening, I sent an email to see if they could squeeze me in. Turns out, they could.

            <p>Throughout this process, I have genuinely enjoyed the experience, it felt like getting a glimpse of what my future career could look like. Building projects aside, one aspect that I particularly relished was the opportunity to connect with fellow coders. Up until this point, my journey had mostly been a solitary one, it took me a moment but as I continued to open up and engage in code discussions with different groups and individuals from various backgrounds it  was an almost surreal feeling. It was a powerful reminder that, to a certain extent, we all spoke the same language even though we have all come from different places and even have different reasons for where we are going. Connecting with a variety of people allowed me to appreciate how far I have come with my learning while also inspiring me to push further!

            <p class="margin-top-10"> With every step I take, my journy it becomes more defined. I am certain of my passion for becoming a developer, as I strongly believe that I possess the foundational skills necessary to learn, problem-solve, create, collaborate, and be accountable. When I undertake something, I strive to do it well, and my goal is to become the most skilled and accomplished developer I can be, both to earn more and to assume greater responsibilities.
            Software development strongly reminds me of music production, where I can lose myself for hours on my laptop, going through trial and error, seeking constant improvement. The beauty of coding is that I can do it anywhere as long as I have my laptop by my side. I view software development in a similar light as I do plumbing or electrical workâ€”it's a craft worth mastering that will serve me throughout my lifetime. 
            Above all, I am convinced that an apprenticeship is the ideal next step for me on this journey to becoming a Dope Dev. Having explored Founders & Coders, I am genuinely captivated by what I see, and I would be thrilled to continue my journey with the Sept 2023 cohort.</p>
