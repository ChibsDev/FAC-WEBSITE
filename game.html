    <h2>Information</h2>
    <h3>Historical favorite for those of us old enough to remember! The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat food and grow longer. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). As the snake consumes food, it increases in length. The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows longer and faster, making it harder to avoid collisions. The game ends if the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body. In the home page you have the ability to change the colour theme of your snake and adjust the difficulty level.</h3>
